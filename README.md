Press CTRL+ALT+L to format your Markdown tables.

Only works for tables that use a pipe character | at the start and end of a row (although Inkdrop supports tables without this).

Uses this pretty printer dependency: https://github.com/imcnaugh/mdTablePrettyPrinter which is also used on https://www.mdtableprettyprinter.com/ by the same author.

Plugin based on the approach in https://github.com/nabework123/inkdrop-convert-list-to-table/
